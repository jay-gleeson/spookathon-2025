# 🎃 Spooky Pomodoro  
### *An AI-Enhanced Haunted Productivity Timer*  

> *"Focus like your grade depends on it... because it probably does."* ☠️  

---

## 🕸️ Overview  
Welcome to **Spooky Pomodoro**, the haunted productivity app that helps you **study smarter (and spookier)**!  
Born under the eerie glow of **Spookathon 2025** at **Orange Coast College (OCC)**, Spooky Pomodoro blends AI sorcery with time-management science to create the *ultimate* study companion.  

Using the **Gemini API**, Spooky Pomodoro conjures the perfect focus and break times — all based on:  
- how long you have to study 🕰️  
- and when your next exam rises from the grave 📚  

No more guessing your Pomodoro lengths — the spirits (and Gemini) have spoken! 👻

## 🧙 Features  
- 🧠 **AI-Optimized Durations** – Uses the Gemini API to calculate ideal focus & break sessions.  
- ⏳ **Study Time Summoner** – Just tell it how long you plan to study and when your exam is.  
- 🕷️ **Simple Yet Spooky UI** – Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a chillingly clean look.  
- 💀 **Flask-Powered Backend** – A Python backend that talks to Gemini and keeps your session cursed and calculated.  
- 🔥 **Dark Mode Always** – Because light mode is for the living.

4. The frontend displays your schedule and keeps time... if you dare.
